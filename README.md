Hi there, I'm Sean. ðŸ‘‹
I am currently a Support Engineer working for a company called [Tanda](https://github.com/TandaHQ) in Brisbane, Australia.

Most of the repositories in here are half finished side-projects, take the work with a grain of salt... ðŸ‘€

I am currently aiming to improve my Ruby/Rails skills and frontend React skills


For a more in-depth view of my works checkout my [portfolio](https://seanmichael07.github.io/) (Don't judge, it needs to be updated ðŸ˜…)
